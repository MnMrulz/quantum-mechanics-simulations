# Quantum Mechanics Simulations

This repository contains analytical and numerical simulations of core quantum mechanics systems.

## Topics Covered
- Particle in a 1D infinite potential well
- Quantum harmonic oscillator
- Wave packet time evolution
- Quantum tunneling
- Expectation values and operators

My focus is on physical interpretation, numerical stability, and visualization.

## Languages
I have used both Python and Scilab for these simulations. Scilab was part of my coursework, and I used it here to better understand the numerical methods behind the physics, alongside Python.
