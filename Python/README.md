# Python Implementations

This directory contains Python implementations of core quantum mechanics simulations.
I wrote the codes with a physics type approach, emphasizing clarity, analytical understanding, and physical interpretation rather than software complexity.

## Simulations Included

### 1. Particle in a 1D Infinite Potential Well
Analytical eigenfunctions and energy spectrum of a particle confined in a one-dimensional box.
Wavefunctions and probability densities are visualized to demonstrate boundary conditions and quantization.

**File:** `particle_in_a_box.py`


### 2. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
Analytical solution of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator using Hermite polynomials.
Eigenfunctions, probability densities, and equally spaced energy levels are visualized.

**File:** `harmonic_oscillator.py`


### 3. Gaussian Wave Packet Dynamics
Time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet for a free particle.
Wave-packet spreading and expectation values illustrate quantum dynamics and correspondence with classical motion.

**File:** `wave_packet_free_particle.py`


### 4. Quantum Tunneling Through a Finite Potential Barrier
Transmission probability for a particle tunneling through a finite square potential barrier.
Demonstrates quantum penetration into classically forbidden regions.

**File:** `finite_barrier_tunneling.py`


## Notes
- Natural units (\(\hbar = m = 1\)) are used unless stated otherwise.
- Codes are intentionally kept simple and well-commented to highlight the underlying physics.
- Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.
